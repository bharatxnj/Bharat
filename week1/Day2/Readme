INSTANT GRATIFICATION - Part 2

Adding AI to Your Production App
Now let's enhance your live production app with OpenAI's API to create dynamic, AI-generated content.

Step 1: 

Get Your OpenAI API Key
If you don't already have an OpenAI API key, follow these steps:

Visit platform.openai.com and sign up for a new account

Add credits to your account:

Go to https://platform.openai.com/settings/organization/billing/overview
Add your $5 minimum payment
Important: Ensure "Auto Recharge" is NOT enabled
Create your API key:

Visit https://platform.openai.com/settings/organization/api-keys
Click "Create new secret key"
Your key will start with sk-proj-...
Copy it to your clipboard
Save it somewhere safe (use a plain text editor, not a word processor like Word that might format the characters)

Step 2: 

Add Your API Key to Vercel

In your Cursor terminal, type:

vercel env add OPENAI_API_KEY
When prompted for the value, paste your API key from the clipboard
Select all environments (development, preview, production) when asked

Step 3: 

Update Dependencies
Open your requirements.txt file and add the OpenAI library:

fastapi
uvicorn
openai
Save the file.

Step 4: 

Update Your Application Code
Replace the entire content of instant.py with:

from fastapi import FastAPI
from fastapi.responses import HTMLResponse
from openai import OpenAI

app = FastAPI()

@app.get("/", response_class=HTMLResponse)
def instant():
    client = OpenAI()
    message = """
You are on a website that has just been deployed to production for the first time!
Please reply with an enthusiastic announcement to welcome visitors to the site, explaining that it is live on production for the first time!
"""
    messages = [{"role": "user", "content": message}]
    response = client.chat.completions.create(model="gpt-5-nano", messages=messages)
    reply = response.choices[0].message.content.replace("\n", "<br/>")
    html = f"<html><head><title>Live in an Instant!</title></head><body><p>{reply}</p></body></html>"
    return html
Save the file.

Step 5: 

Deploy Your AI-Enhanced App
Deploy to development first to test:

vercel .
Once it's deployed:

Visit the URL provided
You should see a dynamic, AI-generated welcome message!
Refresh the page to see different variations
Deploy to production when ready:

vercel --prod

Your app now:

Connects to OpenAI's API using your secure API key
Generates unique, enthusiastic welcome messages for each visitor
