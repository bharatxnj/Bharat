Day 5: Deploy Your SaaS to AWS App Runner
From Vercel to AWS: Professional Cloud Deployment
Today, you'll take your Healthcare Consultation Assistant from Vercel and deploy it to AWS using Docker containers and App Runner. This is how professional teams deploy production applications at scale.

What You'll Learn
Docker containerization for consistent deployments
AWS fundamentals and account setup
AWS App Runner for serverless container hosting
Production deployment patterns used by engineering teams
Cost monitoring to keep your AWS bill under control
Important: Budget Protection First! 💰
AWS charges for resources you use. Let's set up cost alerts BEFORE deploying anything:

Expected costs: With our configuration, expect ~$5-10/month. AWS offers free tier credits for new accounts that should cover your first 3 months.

We'll set up budget alerts at $1, $5, and $10 to track spending. This is a crucial professional practice!

Understanding AWS Services We'll Use
Before we start, let's understand the AWS services:

AWS App Runner
App Runner is AWS's simplest way to deploy containerized web applications. Think of it as "Vercel for Docker containers" - it automatically handles HTTPS certificates, load balancing, and scaling. You just provide a container, and App Runner does the rest.

Amazon ECR (Elastic Container Registry)
ECR is like GitHub but for Docker images. It's where we'll store our containerized application before deploying it to App Runner.

AWS IAM (Identity and Access Management)
IAM controls who can access what in your AWS account. We'll create a special user account with limited permissions for safety - never use your root account for daily work!

CloudWatch
CloudWatch is AWS's monitoring service. It collects logs from your application and helps you debug issues - like having the browser console for your server.

Part 1: Create Your AWS Account
WAIT - HEADS UP - DISCOVERY SINCE GOING TO PRESS!
There's an option for first time users of AWS to select the "free tier" of AWS. Don't choose this! It only has limited access to AWS services, including no access to App Runner (the service we use today). This doesn't mean that you need to pay a subscription or pay for support; just that you need to enter payment details and not be in a sandbox environment. Student Jake C. confirmed that $120 free credits still applied even after signing up for a full account.

This was discovered brilliantly by student Andy C. who shared:

Cryptic App Runner service error message: "The AWS Access Key Id needs a subscription for the service"

I struggled with this message for 24 hours and wanted to let everyone know the root cause. I get it when (1) I try to set up a new "Auto scaling" config (e.g., "Basic" that Ed suggests) and (2) when I try to save and create my app runner service.

Here was the problem: I was signed up for the free tier of AWS. Apparently the free tier does not allow for you to use App Runner. Argh. Once I upgraded to paid tier, I was golden.

I tried so many other things to try to fix this issue and spent hours trying to understand IAM, thinking that was the problem. I hope this message saves someone else a huge amount of time!

This is an example of the kind of infrastructure horrors you may face - and with enormous appreciation to Andy for digging in, finding the root cause and sharing with us all.

With that in mind:

Step 1: Sign Up for AWS
Visit aws.amazon.com
Click Create an AWS Account
Enter your email and choose a password
Select Personal account type (for learning)
Enter payment information (required, but we'll set up cost alerts)
Verify your phone number via SMS
Select Basic Support - Free
You now have an AWS root account. This is like having admin access - powerful but dangerous!

Step 2: Secure Your Root Account
Sign in to AWS Console
Click your account name (top right) → Security credentials
Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):
Click Assign MFA device
Name: root-mfa
Select Authenticator app
Scan QR code with Google Authenticator or Authy
Enter two consecutive codes
Click Add MFA
Step 3: Set Up Budget Alerts (Critical!)
In AWS Console, search for Billing and click Billing and Cost Management
In the left menu, click Budgets
Click Create budget
Select Use a template (simplified)
Choose Monthly cost budget
Set up three budgets:
Budget 1 - Early Warning ($1):

Budget name: early-warning
Enter budgeted amount: 1 USD
Email recipients: Enter your email address
Click Create budget
Budget 2 - Caution ($5):

Repeat steps: Create budget → Use a template → Monthly cost budget
Budget name: caution-budget
Enter budgeted amount: 5 USD
Email recipients: Enter your email address
Click Create budget
Budget 3 - Stop Alert ($10):

Repeat steps: Create budget → Use a template → Monthly cost budget
Budget name: stop-budget
Enter budgeted amount: 10 USD
Email recipients: Enter your email address
Click Create budget
AWS will automatically notify you when:

Your actual spend reaches 85% of budget
Your actual spend reaches 100% of budget
Your forecasted spend is expected to reach 100%
If you hit $10, stop and review what's running!

Step 4: Create an IAM User for Daily Work
Never use your root account for daily work. Let's create a limited user:

Search for IAM in the AWS Console
Click Users → Create user
Username: aiengineer
Check ✅ Provide user access to the AWS Management Console
Select I want to create an IAM user
Choose Custom password and set a strong password
Uncheck ⬜ Users must create a new password at next sign-in
Click Next
Step 5: Create a User Group with Permissions
We'll create a reusable permission group first, then add our user to it:

On the permissions page, select Add user to group
Click Create group
Group name: BroadAIEngineerAccess
In the permissions policies search, find and check these policies:
AWSAppRunnerFullAccess - to deploy applications
AmazonEC2ContainerRegistryFullAccess - to store Docker images
CloudWatchLogsFullAccess - to view logs
IAMUserChangePassword - to manage own credentials
IMPORTANT: also IAMFullAccess - I don't think I mention this in the video, but it must be included or you will get errors later! Thank you Anthony W and Jake C for pointing this out.
Click Create user group
Back on the permissions page, select the BroadAIEngineerAccess group (it should be checked)
Click Next → Create user
Important: Click Download .csv file and save it securely!
It's worth keeping in mind that you might get permissions errors thoughout the course, when AWS complains that your user doesn't have permission to do something. The solution is usually to come back to this screen (as the root user) and attach another policy! This is a very common chore working with AWS...

Step 6: Sign In as IAM User
Sign out from root account
Go to your AWS sign-in URL (in the CSV file, looks like: https://123456789012.signin.aws.amazon.com/console)
Sign in with:
Username: aiengineer
Password: (the one you created)
✅ Checkpoint: You should see "aiengineer @ Account-ID" in the top right corner

Part 2: Install Docker Desktop
Docker lets us package our application into a container - like a shipping container for software!

Step 1: Install Docker Desktop
Visit docker.com/products/docker-desktop
Download for your system:
Mac: Download for Mac (Apple Silicon or Intel)
Windows: Download for Windows (requires Windows 10/11)
Run the installer
Windows users: Docker Desktop will install WSL2 if needed - accept all prompts
Start Docker Desktop
You may need to restart your computer
Step 2: Verify Docker Works
Open Terminal (Mac) or PowerShell (Windows):

docker --version
You should see: Docker version 26.x.x or similar

Test Docker:

docker run hello-world
You should see a message starting with "Hello from Docker!" confirming Docker is working correctly.

✅ Checkpoint: Docker Desktop icon should be running (whale icon in system tray/menu bar)

Part 3: Prepare Your Application
We need to modify our Day 4 application for AWS deployment. The key change: we'll export Next.js as static files and serve everything from a single container.

Step 1: Update Project Structure
Your project should look like this:

saas/
├── pages/                  # Next.js Pages Router
├── styles/                 # CSS styles
├── api/                    # FastAPI backend
├── public/                 # Static assets
├── node_modules/          
├── .env.local             # Your secrets (never commit!)
├── .gitignore
├── package.json
├── requirements.txt
├── next.config.ts
└── tsconfig.json
Step 2: Convert to Static Export
Important Architecture Change: On Vercel, our Next.js app could make server-side requests. For AWS simplicity, we'll export Next.js as static HTML/JS files and serve them from our Python backend. This means everything runs in one container!

Note about Middleware: With Pages Router, we don't use middleware files. Authentication is handled entirely by Clerk's client-side components (<Protect>, <SignedIn>, etc.) which work perfectly with static exports.

Update next.config.ts:

import type { NextConfig } from "next";

const nextConfig: NextConfig = {
  output: 'export',  // This exports static HTML/JS files
  images: {
    unoptimized: true  // Required for static export
  }
};

export default nextConfig;
Step 3: Update Frontend API Calls
Since we're serving everything from the same container, we need to update how the frontend calls the backend.

Update pages/product.tsx - find the fetchEventSource call and change it:

// Old (Vercel):
await fetchEventSource('/api', {

// New (AWS):
await fetchEventSource('/api/consultation', {
This works because both frontend and backend will be served from the same domain!

Step 4: Update Backend Server
Create a new file api/server.py (updating our FastAPI server for AWS):

import os
from pathlib import Path
from fastapi import FastAPI, Depends
from fastapi.responses import StreamingResponse, FileResponse
from fastapi.staticfiles import StaticFiles
from fastapi.middleware.cors import CORSMiddleware
from pydantic import BaseModel
from fastapi_clerk_auth import ClerkConfig, ClerkHTTPBearer, HTTPAuthorizationCredentials
from openai import OpenAI

app = FastAPI()

# Add CORS middleware (allows frontend to call backend)
app.add_middleware(
    CORSMiddleware,
    allow_origins=["*"],
    allow_credentials=True,
    allow_methods=["*"],
    allow_headers=["*"],
)

# Clerk authentication setup
clerk_config = ClerkConfig(jwks_url=os.getenv("CLERK_JWKS_URL"))
clerk_guard = ClerkHTTPBearer(clerk_config)

class Visit(BaseModel):
    patient_name: str
    date_of_visit: str
    notes: str

system_prompt = """
You are provided with notes written by a doctor from a patient's visit.
Your job is to summarize the visit for the doctor and provide an email.
Reply with exactly three sections with the headings:
### Summary of visit for the doctor's records
### Next steps for the doctor
### Draft of email to patient in patient-friendly language
"""

def user_prompt_for(visit: Visit) -> str:
    return f"""Create the summary, next steps and draft email for:
Patient Name: {visit.patient_name}
Date of Visit: {visit.date_of_visit}
Notes:
{visit.notes}"""

@app.post("/api/consultation")
def consultation_summary(
    visit: Visit,
    creds: HTTPAuthorizationCredentials = Depends(clerk_guard),
):
    user_id = creds.decoded["sub"]
    client = OpenAI()
    
    user_prompt = user_prompt_for(visit)
    prompt = [
        {"role": "system", "content": system_prompt},
        {"role": "user", "content": user_prompt},
    ]
    
    stream = client.chat.completions.create(
        model="gpt-5-nano",
        messages=prompt,
        stream=True,
    )
    
    def event_stream():
        for chunk in stream:
            text = chunk.choices[0].delta.content
            if text:
                lines = text.split("\n")
                for line in lines[:-1]:
                    yield f"data: {line}\n\n"
                    yield "data:  \n"
                yield f"data: {lines[-1]}\n\n"
    
    return StreamingResponse(event_stream(), media_type="text/event-stream")

@app.get("/health")
def health_check():
    """Health check endpoint for AWS App Runner"""
    return {"status": "healthy"}

# Serve static files (our Next.js export) - MUST BE LAST!
static_path = Path("static")
if static_path.exists():
    # Serve index.html for the root path
    @app.get("/")
    async def serve_root():
        return FileResponse(static_path / "index.html")
    
    # Mount static files for all other routes
    app.mount("/", StaticFiles(directory="static", html=True), name="static")
Step 5: Create Environment File for AWS
Create .env file (copy from .env.local but add AWS info):

# Copy your values from .env.local
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_...
CLERK_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_...
CLERK_JWKS_URL=https://...
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...

# Add AWS configuration (use your chosen region from earlier) - us-east-1 or eu-west-1 etc
DEFAULT_AWS_REGION=us-east-1
AWS_ACCOUNT_ID=123456789012
To find your AWS Account ID:

In AWS Console, click your username (top right)
Copy the 12-digit Account ID
Important: Add .env to your .gitignore file if not already there!

Part 4: Create Docker Configuration
Docker lets us package everything into a single container that runs anywhere.

Step 1: Create Dockerfile
Create Dockerfile in your project root:

# Stage 1: Build the Next.js static files
FROM node:22-alpine AS frontend-builder

WORKDIR /app

# Copy package files first (for better caching)
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm ci

# Copy all frontend files
COPY . .

# Build argument for Clerk public key
ARG NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY
ENV NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=$NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY

# Note: Docker may warn about "secrets in ARG/ENV" - this is OK!
# The NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY is meant to be public (it starts with pk_)
# It's safe to include in the build as it's designed for client-side use

# Build the Next.js app (creates 'out' directory with static files)
RUN npm run build

# Stage 2: Create the final Python container
FROM python:3.12-slim

WORKDIR /app

# Install Python dependencies
COPY requirements.txt .
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

# Copy the FastAPI server
COPY api/server.py .

# Copy the Next.js static export from builder stage
COPY --from=frontend-builder /app/out ./static

# Health check
HEALTHCHECK --interval=30s --timeout=3s --start-period=5s --retries=3 \
  CMD python -c "import urllib.request; urllib.request.urlopen('http://localhost:8000/health')"

# Expose port 8000 (FastAPI will serve everything)
EXPOSE 8000

# Start the FastAPI server
CMD ["uvicorn", "server:app", "--host", "0.0.0.0", "--port", "8000"]
Step 2: Create .dockerignore
Create .dockerignore to exclude unnecessary files:

node_modules
.next
.env
.env.local
.git
.gitignore
README.md
.DS_Store
*.log
.vercel
dist
build
Part 5: Build and Test Locally
Let's test our containerized app before deploying to AWS.

Step 1: Load Environment Variables
Mac/Linux (Terminal):

export $(cat .env | grep -v '^#' | xargs)
Windows (PowerShell):

Get-Content .env | ForEach-Object {
    if ($_ -match '^(.+?)=(.+)$') {
        [System.Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable($matches[1], $matches[2])
    }
}
Step 2: Build the Docker Image
Build your container:

Mac/Linux:

docker build \
  --build-arg NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY="$NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY" \
  -t consultation-app .
Windows PowerShell:

docker build `
  --build-arg NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY="$env:NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY" `
  -t consultation-app .
This will take 2-3 minutes the first time.

Step 3: Run Locally
Mac/Linux:

docker run -p 8000:8000 \
  -e CLERK_SECRET_KEY="$CLERK_SECRET_KEY" \
  -e CLERK_JWKS_URL="$CLERK_JWKS_URL" \
  -e OPENAI_API_KEY="$OPENAI_API_KEY" \
  consultation-app
Windows PowerShell:

docker run -p 8000:8000 `
  -e CLERK_SECRET_KEY="$env:CLERK_SECRET_KEY" `
  -e CLERK_JWKS_URL="$env:CLERK_JWKS_URL" `
  -e OPENAI_API_KEY="$env:OPENAI_API_KEY" `
  consultation-app
Step 4: Test Your Application
Open browser to http://localhost:8000
Sign in with your Clerk account
Test the consultation form
Verify everything works!
To stop: Press Ctrl+C in the terminal

✅ Checkpoint: Application works identically to Vercel version

Part 6: Deploy to AWS
Now let's deploy our container to AWS App Runner!

Step 1: Create ECR Repository
ECR (Elastic Container Registry) is where we'll store our Docker image.

In AWS Console, search for ECR
Click Get started or Create repository
Important: Make sure you're in the correct region (top right of AWS Console - should match your DEFAULT_AWS_REGION)
Settings:
Visibility settings: Private
Repository name: consultation-app (must match exactly!)
Leave all other settings as default
Click Create repository
Verify: You should see your new consultation-app repository in the list
Step 2: Set Up AWS CLI
We need AWS CLI to push our image.

Create Access Keys
In AWS Console, go to IAM
Click Users → click on aiengineer
Click Security credentials tab
Under Access keys, click Create access key
Select Command Line Interface (CLI)
Check the confirmation box → Next
Description: Docker push access
Click Create access key
Critical: Download CSV or copy both:
Access key ID (like: AKIAIOSFODNN7EXAMPLE)
Secret access key (like: wJalrXUtnFEMI/K7MDENG/bPxRfiCY)
Click Done
Configure AWS CLI
Install AWS CLI if you haven't:

Mac: brew install awscli or download from aws.amazon.com/cli
Windows: Download installer from aws.amazon.com/cli
Configure it:

aws configure
Enter:

AWS Access Key ID: (paste your key)
AWS Secret Access Key: (paste your secret)
Default region: Choose based on your location:
US East Coast: us-east-1 (N. Virginia)
US West Coast: us-west-2 (Oregon)
Europe: eu-west-1 (Ireland)
Asia: ap-southeast-1 (Singapore)
Pick the closest region for best performance!
Default output format: json
Important: Remember your region choice - you'll use it throughout this course!

Step 3: Push Image to ECR
In ECR console, click your consultation-app repository
Click View push commands
Since you already have your AWS info in .env, let's use it!
First, make sure your environment variables are loaded (from Part 5, Step 1).

Understanding the authentication: The first command gets a temporary password from AWS and pipes it to Docker. You won't be prompted for a password - it's all automatic!

Mac/Linux:

# 1. Authenticate Docker to ECR (using your .env values!)
aws ecr get-login-password --region $DEFAULT_AWS_REGION | docker login --username AWS --password-stdin $AWS_ACCOUNT_ID.dkr.ecr.$DEFAULT_AWS_REGION.amazonaws.com

# 2. Build for Linux/AMD64 (CRITICAL for Apple Silicon Macs!)
docker build \
  --platform linux/amd64 \
  --build-arg NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY="$NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY" \
  -t consultation-app .

# 3. Tag your image (using your .env values!)
docker tag consultation-app:latest $AWS_ACCOUNT_ID.dkr.ecr.$DEFAULT_AWS_REGION.amazonaws.com/consultation-app:latest

# 4. Push to ECR
docker push $AWS_ACCOUNT_ID.dkr.ecr.$DEFAULT_AWS_REGION.amazonaws.com/consultation-app:latest
Windows PowerShell:

# 1. Authenticate Docker to ECR (using your .env values!)
aws ecr get-login-password --region $env:DEFAULT_AWS_REGION | docker login --username AWS --password-stdin "$env:AWS_ACCOUNT_ID.dkr.ecr.$env:DEFAULT_AWS_REGION.amazonaws.com"

# 2. Build for Linux/AMD64
docker build `
  --platform linux/amd64 `
  --build-arg NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY="$env:NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY" `
  -t consultation-app .

# 3. Tag your image (using your .env values!)
docker tag consultation-app:latest "$env:AWS_ACCOUNT_ID.dkr.ecr.$env:DEFAULT_AWS_REGION.amazonaws.com/consultation-app:latest"

# 4. Push to ECR
docker push "$env:AWS_ACCOUNT_ID.dkr.ecr.$env:DEFAULT_AWS_REGION.amazonaws.com/consultation-app:latest"
Note for Apple Silicon (M1/M2/M3) Macs: The --platform linux/amd64 flag is ESSENTIAL. Without it, your container won't run on AWS!

The push will take 2-5 minutes depending on your internet speed.

✅ Checkpoint: In ECR console, you should see your image with tag latest

Part 7: Create App Runner Service
Step 1: Launch App Runner
In AWS Console, search for App Runner
Click Create service
Step 2: Configure Source
Source:
Repository type: Container registry
Provider: Amazon ECR
Click Browse
Select consultation-app → Select latest tag
Deployment settings:
Deployment trigger: Manual (to control costs)
ECR access role: Create new service role
Click Next
Step 3: Configure Service
Service name: consultation-app-service

Virtual CPU & memory:

vCPU: 0.25 vCPU
Memory: 0.5 GB
Environment variables - Click Add environment variable for each:

CLERK_SECRET_KEY = (paste your value)
CLERK_JWKS_URL = (paste your value)
OPENAI_API_KEY = (paste your value)
Note: We don't need NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY here - it's baked into the static files!

Port: 8000 (Important: our FastAPI server runs on 8000)

Auto scaling:

Minimum size: 1 (AWS requires at least 1 instance)
Maximum size: 1 (keeps costs low)
Click Next

Step 4: Configure Health Check
Health check configuration:

Protocol: HTTP
Path: /health
Interval: 20 seconds (maximum allowed)
Timeout: 5 seconds
Healthy threshold: 2
Unhealthy threshold: 5
Click Next

Step 5: Review and Create
Review all settings
Click Create & deploy
Wait 5-10 minutes - watch the Events log
Status will change from "Operation in progress" to "Running"
✅ Checkpoint: Service shows "Running" with green checkmark

Step 6: Access Your Application
Click on the Default domain URL (like: abc123.YOUR-REGION.awsapprunner.com)
Your app should load with HTTPS automatically enabled!
Test all functionality:
Sign in with Clerk
Create a consultation summary
Sign out
🎉 Congratulations! Your healthcare app is now running on AWS!

Part 8: Monitoring and Debugging
View Logs
In your App Runner service, click Logs tab
Application logs: Your app's console output
System logs: Deployment and infrastructure logs
Click View in CloudWatch for detailed analysis
Common Issues and Solutions
"Unhealthy" status:

Check application logs for Python errors
Verify all environment variables are set
Ensure health check path is /health
"Authentication failed":

Double-check Clerk environment variables
Verify JWKS URL is correct
Check CloudWatch logs for specific errors
Page not loading:

Ensure port is set to 8000
Check that Docker image was built with --platform linux/amd64
Verify static files are being served
Part 9: Updating Your Application
When you make code changes:

Step 1: Rebuild and Push
Mac/Linux:

# 1. Rebuild with platform flag
docker build \
  --platform linux/amd64 \
  --build-arg NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY="$NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY" \
  -t consultation-app .

# 2. Tag for ECR (use your account ID and region from .env file)
docker tag consultation-app:latest YOUR-ACCOUNT-ID.dkr.ecr.YOUR-REGION.amazonaws.com/consultation-app:latest

# 3. Push to ECR
docker push YOUR-ACCOUNT-ID.dkr.ecr.YOUR-REGION.amazonaws.com/consultation-app:latest
Windows PowerShell:

# 1. Rebuild with platform flag
docker build `
  --platform linux/amd64 `
  --build-arg NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY="$env:NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY" `
  -t consultation-app .

# 2. Tag for ECR (use your account ID and region from .env file)
docker tag consultation-app:latest YOUR-ACCOUNT-ID.dkr.ecr.YOUR-REGION.amazonaws.com/consultation-app:latest

# 3. Push to ECR
docker push YOUR-ACCOUNT-ID.dkr.ecr.YOUR-REGION.amazonaws.com/consultation-app:latest
Step 2: Deploy Update
Go to App Runner console
Click your service
Click Deploy
Wait for deployment to complete
Cost Management
What This Costs
With our minimal configuration (1 instance always running):

App Runner: ~$0.007/hour = ~$5/month for continuous running
ECR: ~$0.10/GB/month for image storage
Total: ~$5-6/month
Note: AWS App Runner requires at least 1 instance running, so you'll pay for continuous availability. To save money, you can pause the service when not in use.

How to Save Money
Pause when not using: Pause your App Runner service (Actions → Pause service)
Use free tier: New AWS accounts get credits
Monitor budgets: Check your email for alerts
Clean up ECR: Delete old image versions
Emergency Cost Control
If you hit budget alerts:

Go to App Runner → Select service → Actions → Pause service
Review CloudWatch logs for any issues
Check ECR for multiple image versions (delete old ones)
What You've Accomplished
You've successfully:

✅ Created a production AWS account with security best practices
✅ Containerized a full-stack application with Docker
✅ Deployed to AWS App Runner with HTTPS and monitoring
✅ Set up cost controls and budget alerts
✅ Learned professional deployment patterns
Architecture Comparison: Vercel vs AWS
Vercel Architecture:

Next.js runs on Vercel's servers
API routes handled by Vercel Functions
Automatic deployments from Git
Zero-config setup
AWS Architecture:

Everything runs in a single Docker container
FastAPI serves both API and static files
Manual deployments (or automated with CI/CD)
Full control over infrastructure
Both are valid approaches! Vercel optimizes for developer experience, while AWS offers more control and flexibility.

Next Steps
Immediate Improvements
Custom domain: Add your own domain in App Runner settings
Auto-deployment: Set up GitHub Actions for automated deployments
Monitoring: Add CloudWatch alarms for errors
Advanced Enhancements
Database: Add Amazon RDS for data persistence
File storage: Use S3 for user uploads
Caching: Add ElastiCache for performance
CDN: Use CloudFront for global distribution
Secrets Manager: Store sensitive data securely
